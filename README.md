# MAF + MADE for Anomaly Detection on Capsule Dataset

This repository contains the practical implementation of a **Masked Autoregressive Flow (MAF)** with a **MADE** network for density estimation and anomaly detection on a capsule inspection dataset.

The model is trained only on *normal* samples and then used to detect anomalies based on the **negative log-likelihood (NLL)**.
